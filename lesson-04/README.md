Hi professor
I really enjoy learning more about canvas. Canvas is a great tag element. I really like that there are already a large group of libraries where you can get some dynamic elements. For this exercise I used the paper and the Easel.js libraries. I follow the tutorial for the first exercise using the paper library, although something wasn't working right in the paper.js, but finally I figured out a way around, and now it works. I also work in an exercise from easel, It was challenge, but pretty interesting especially knowing that you can use all this libraries and modified them for your convenience. The links for both exercises are in my portfolio under lesson 4 in HTM5 and Web programing.

Have a great day!!
